# A Garmin Watch Face

I lost access to my favorite Garmin watchface after a developer moved some of the features from the free to paid version.
I wanted a watchface that could display the normal data (date and time) while also showing other metrics (calories, steps, VO2 max, and current heartrate). 

Using Garmin's SDK, I coded a watchface that would meet my needs. This app is written in Monkey C (Garmin's amalgamation of Java, C, Python, etc) and uses several of Garmin's APIs to pull data from a users watch and display it on their screen.
