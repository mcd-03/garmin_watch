# A Garmin Watch Face

I lost access to my favorite Garmin watchface after a developer changed the status of my the watchface from free to purchase.
I wanted a watchface that could display the normal data (date and time) while also showing other metrics (calories, steps, VO2 max, and current heartrate). 

Using Garmin's SDK, this app is written in Monkey C and uses several of their APIs to pull data from a users watch and display it on their screen.
